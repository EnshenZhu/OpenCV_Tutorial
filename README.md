## What is Computer Vision

A computer vision is an application of deep
earning that primarily focuses on deriving
insights from media files (images and videos).

## What is OpenCV

It is a computer vision library that is available
in Python, C++ and Java.

## Install the OpenCV library

### OpenCV

1. Open the terminal
2. ```pip install opencv-contrib-python```
3. This library includes the **main model** and
   the **contribution module** of the OpenCV
   library
4. The OpenCV library installation will also
   install the **numpy package** (for scientific
   computing).

### Caer

1. ```pip install caer```
2. This is the package to help speed up the
   workflow with a set of utility functions.
